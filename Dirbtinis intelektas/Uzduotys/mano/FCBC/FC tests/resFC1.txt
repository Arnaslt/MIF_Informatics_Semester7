    2) .... Goal F. Find R6: [C, D] -> F. New goals:[C, D]
    3) .... Goal C. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C]
    4) ...... Goal D. Find R7: [A] -> D. New goals:[A]
    5) ...... Goal A. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C]
    6) ...... Goal D. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, B, C, D], Backtracking. OK
    7) .... Goal F. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, B, C, D, F], Backtracking. OK
    8) .. Goal B. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C]
