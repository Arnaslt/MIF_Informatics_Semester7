PART 1. Data
	1) Rules:
		R1: [G] -> Z
		R2: [A] -> G
		R3: [A] -> B
		R4: [B] -> C
		R5: [C] -> D
		R6: [D] -> Z

	2) Given facts:
		A

	3) Goal:
		Z

PART 2. Execution

    1) .. Goal Z. Find R1: [G] -> Z. New goals:[G]
    2) .... Goal G. Find R2: [A] -> G. New goals:[A]
    3) .... Goal A. Fact was given, current DB:[A]
    4) .... Goal G. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, G], Backtracking. OK
    5) .. Goal Z. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, G, Z], Backtracking. OK

PART 3. Results
	1) Z was deduced
	2) Path: [R2, R1]
