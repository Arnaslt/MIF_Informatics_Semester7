PART 1. Data
	1) Rules:
		R1: [Y, D] -> Z
		R2: [X, B, E] -> Y
		R3: [A] -> X
		R4: [C] -> L
		R5: [L, M] -> N

	2) Given facts:
		A
		B
		C
		D
		E

	3) Goal:
		Z

PART 2. Execution

    1) .. Goal Z. Find R1: [Y, D] -> Z. New goals:[Y, D]
    2) .... Goal Y. Find R2: [X, B, E] -> Y. New goals:[X, B, E]
    3) ...... Goal X. Find R3: [A] -> X. New goals:[A]
    4) ...... Goal A. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E]
    5) ...... Goal X. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E, X], Backtracking. OK
    6) .... Goal B. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E]
    7) .... Goal E. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E]
    8) .... Goal Y. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E, X, Y], Backtracking. OK
    9) .. Goal D. Fact was given, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E]
   10) .. Goal Z. New Fact recieved, current DB:[A, B, C, D, E, X, Y, Z], Backtracking. OK

PART 3. Results
	1) Z was deduced
	2) Path: [R3, R2, R1]
